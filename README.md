# LemarConnect Alguos *(Devloppment phase)*

Lemar Connect is a modular sensor network designed to monitor algae cultivation tanks, developed for the Laboratory Lemar at the IUEM. This project prioritizes long-term autonomy (10 years), modularity, and user-friendliness, while ensuring precise monitoring of environmental parameters such as light intensity, temperature, and humidity.

## Solutions used:

- InfluxDB / MangoDB for data storage
- Grafana for visualization.
- The Things Network / The Things Stack for LoRaWAN communication.
- Arduino IDE for embedded development.
