# LemarConnect Alguos

Lemar Connect is a modular sensor network designed to monitor algae cultivation tanks. This project focuses on autonomy (10 years), modularity, and ease of use, while providing accurate tracking of environmental parameters such as light intensity, temperature, and humidity.

## Solutions used:

- InfluxDB for data storage
- Grafana for visualization.
- The Things Network / The Things Stack for LoRaWAN communication.
- Arduino IDE for embedded development.
